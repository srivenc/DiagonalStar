# DiagonalStar
Creates a rectangular set of asterixes based on what number is entered into the method.

Directions:
Write a method named printSquareStar with one parameter of type int named number. 

If number is < 5, the method should print "Invalid Value".

The method should print diagonals to generate a rectangular pattern composed of stars (*). This should be accomplished by using loops (see examples below).


EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

EXAMPLE 1

printSquareStar(5); should print the following:

→ NOTE: For text in Code Blocks below, use code icon {...}  on Udemy

*****
** **
* * *
** **
*****


Explanation:

*****   5 stars
** **   2 stars space 2 stars
* * *   1 star space 1 star space 1 star
** **   2 stars space 2 stars
*****   5 stars


EXAMPLE 2

printSquareStar(8); should print the following:

********
**    **
* *  * *
*  **  *
*  **  *
* *  * *
**    **
********


The patterns above consist of a number of rows and columns (where number is the number of rows to print). For each row or column, stars are printed based on four conditions (Read them carefully):

* In the first or last row

* In the first or last column

* When the row number equals the column number

* When the column number equals rowCount - currentRow + 1 (where currentRow is current row number)
